Gotai's Instance Timer

Simple timer to boast about in guild for moar epeen.

**Changelog:
1.2 -> 1.21
I'm the git here it seems. Querying raid members by using "party7" obviously does not work. Sorry.

1.1 -> 1.2
Implemented a report function. Usage is more or less the same as showrecord.
Usage:	'/git report' to display a list of records.
        '/git report # chan' reports channel corresponding to # to chan.
Currently allowed channels are: guild, party and raid. g,p and r may be used for short.

1.0 -> 1.1
Started work on a showrecords function. It seems to be working now, although I'm not sure if I'm happy with how it turned out.
Usage: '/git showrecord' to display a list of records.
       '/git showrecord #' to display record corresponding to #

Beta -> 1.0
Two months of no bugs warrants a push to 1.0 I reckon. Yay!

Beta 2.1 -> Beta 2.2
Timer is now colored depending on how close to the record you are.
Also added some more slash commands:
/git stop - Stops the timer, doesn't save anything. Use this for aborted runs.
/git save - Stops and saves the timer. Use this if the timer doesn't autostop/save for some reason.
/git toggle - Toggles visibility of the timer.
/git debug - Enables logging a Dampscale Basilisk in Terokkar Forest. You shouldn't have to use this unless you're trying to recreate an error.

Beta2 -> Beta2.1
Checking mobID instead of mobname for registering kills. Hopefuly fixes Ramparts bug. Feedback needed!
Added a visual timer.

More slash commands will come next push, just wanted to get this out here to see if it fixes Ramparts.


Beta1 -> Beta2

GIT should now start timers automatically when you enter combat in a zone that is in GIT's list.
GIT should now distinguish between normal and heroic mode.
GIT should now save group composition (names and class) on completion.

Notice the SHOULD, it's beta, expect bugs. ;)

Unfortunately, due to the saved var overhaul, Beta1 records will not be imported.
If you wish to save them, write the values down, and once you've upgraded run:
/run GIT_Records[zone][difficulty][time] = seconds
for each entry. zone, difficulty and seconds have to be replaced by their proper values.
difficulty accepts "normal" or "heroic". So for instance, for my heroic SP run that took 1.5 hours:
/run GIT_Records["The Slave Pens"]["heroic"][time] = 5400

Sorry for the inconvenience, but I didn't see another way. It'll be a one time thing though. :)
